			<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
			<h2>Landing page /home (index.html)</h2>
			<h3> Introduce the typeface. This page must include the following sections:</h3>
		  <p> 
		  <li>Hero section: title in a visual composition to captivate the audience - can be designed in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Procreate and brought in as a jpg</li>
				<li>the individual characters of the typeface (Aa–Zz, 0–9, and punctuation),</li>
				<li>Brief information about the typeface, designed with a visual hierarchy of headers and body text. This could include: <em>year it was created, Designer of the typeface, Brief history, description (body text)</em></li>

			<h2>TASK</h2>
			<p>As a team of three, pick a typeface, come up with an identity package (including the color scheme and visuals), and code a website with multiple pages to display a comprehensive showcase of the typeface. Read about typography here and on Google.</p>
			<h2>BRIEF</h2>
			<p>As a group, pick a font from the table on the last page. Design, develop, and publish an interactive website as a team design to visually introduce the letters of a font. The website will demonstrate a variety of ways the type could be imagined to be used in different performance situations (display-level, body copy level, and experimental layouts). To gain familiarity with typography for the web, showcase a web-based typeface in a multiple-page website developed and published in Dreamweaver using HTML and CSS. The images on the website will be created by you, but the textual content for case studies will be copied from the Dribbble Article Choosing typography for web design.
